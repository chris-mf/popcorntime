## Installation
As a prerequisite it's assumed you have installed [node.js](http://nodejs.org), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Bundler](http://bundler.io). To start using the boilerplate you need to run the following terminal commands.

Change directory to the boilerplate directory and install dependencies

**Hint**: If you get errors while installing `gulp-imagemin` it may help to execute this command before running `npm install`:

```sh
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig
```
